### Background
 The Original Olympus Client was started around Aug 23rd by **[REDACTED]**, **[REDACTED]**, **[REDACTED]** and Former Olympus Moderator Dustin. Then Dustin was found untrustworthy while suspiosion of him **snitching** to Poseidon was founded. Which the caused Poseidon to tell Fedot to create a filter for the API he created. Later Dustin was EXILED from the group and **[REDACTED]** was added. **[REDACTED]** then proposed a plan that reborn the client. After months of Work version 2 was  released. For many months the Dev Team went undetected until *<TO BE ADDED>* fucked up and got all members of the Dev Team perm banned from the Server on *<To Be added>*. In rebilion the Dev Team released this Repository to the public on *<To be Added>*. Which was quickly stopped when a push was added to the API stopping the exploit the client uses.
