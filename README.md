### Background
The Original Olympus Client was started on the 1st of August by **[REDACTED]**, **[REDACTED]**, and **[REDACTED]** after **[REDACTED]** and **[REDACTED]** got banned for fail RP and RDM. The original script was written in PHP.

The 3 co-developers and former Olympus Moderator Dustin, used the program making slight improvements to its readability. Later on in that same month, **[REDACTED]** decided to write the program in C# to make use of all the information the API had to offer. It was at this point where we decided to exclude **Dustin** for fear of him being a snitch for donator perks. The development of the C# took of despite the hurdles and setbacks given by Fedot and Posiedon. We soon involved **Fedot** in the project after discovering he had the same interests in tracking people. With the contributions to the API by **Fedot** the team was able make even more progress on the program by adding a map that tracked locations of active players and their houses.
 
 ## Change Log
 
 ### 9/10 **House Addition**
    New Shit:
    Player's houses are now shown on a map along with the virtual inventory.
    Clicking on a player in the player list will center the map on their location.

### 10/4 **RIP**
**Fedot** Gave away his valued code for a shiny ingame vehicle. The project is currently on hold until new developments on a possible workaround surface.

### 10/17 ***RIP 4 REAL***
Its been two weeks without any word of the project coming back online. At this point it is safe to declassify the name of the idiot who cause the termination of the project. Fed0t
